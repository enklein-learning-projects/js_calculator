Improving the vanilla JS calculator made during the Frontend Master's Bootcamp to fix a few bugs and UX issues:
- Fixed an issue caused by clicking the borders â€” previously this would would pull the values of all buttons nested within the same div, now the bug's gone.
- Inputting `3 + 3 =` would display `6`. Inputting `4` immediately after would produce `64`. That's been fixed!
- Clicking on an operator would set the display to `0` until another number is clicked - fixed!
